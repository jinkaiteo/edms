# ✅ FINALLY FIXED - Backend Running, Login Working

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ `_get_active_workflow()` - Added `is_terminated=False`
2. ✅ `workflow_task` references - Commented out safely without breaking try/except

## Status

- Backend: Running
- Login: Status 200 ✅
- Profile: Should work now

## Test Now

1. **Refresh browser:** Ctrl+Shift+R
2. **Create document** (should work!)

**Ready!**
