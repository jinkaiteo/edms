feat: Implement efficient periodic review with up-versioning workflow

Implement periodic review workflow that reuses existing up-versioning modal
instead of auto-creating versions, reducing code duplication and improving UX.

APPROACH:
- Periodic review records outcome (CONFIRMED/MINOR_UPVERSION/MAJOR_UPVERSION)
- For up-version outcomes: Opens existing CreateNewVersionModal
- User selects minor/major and provides details in version modal
- Version created through existing tested workflow
- Zero code duplication

BACKEND CHANGES:
- Update DocumentReview.REVIEW_OUTCOMES:
  * CONFIRMED (no changes)
  * MINOR_UPVERSION (opens version modal)
  * MAJOR_UPVERSION (opens version modal)

- Simplified periodic_review_service.py:
  * Removed auto-version creation logic (~50 lines)
  * Just records review outcome
  * Frontend handles version creation
  * Response includes: requires_upversion flag

- Migration 0005_update_periodic_review_outcomes:
  * Updates choice field in document_reviews table
  * Applied successfully

FRONTEND CHANGES:
- Update TypeScript types (api.ts):
  * ReviewOutcome type updated
  * Review context interface for modal handoff

- Refactored PeriodicReviewModal.tsx:
  * CONFIRMED: Completes review immediately
  * MINOR/MAJOR_UPVERSION: Closes and opens version modal
  * Passes review context to parent component
  * Button: "Continue to Version Creation"
  * Clear 4-step process explanation

- Enhanced DocumentViewer.tsx:
  * Store periodicReviewContext state
  * Handle modal transition (review → version)
  * Pass context to version modal

- Maintained ReviewHistoryTab.tsx:
  * Display outcome badges
  * Show version links when created
  * Legacy support for old outcomes

WORKFLOW:
1. CONFIRMED:
   - User enters comments
   - Clicks "Complete Review"
   - Backend records review
   - Document stays EFFECTIVE

2. MINOR/MAJOR_UPVERSION:
   - User enters preliminary comments
   - Clicks "Continue to Version Creation"
   - Backend records review outcome
   - Frontend opens CreateNewVersionModal
   - User selects minor/major (can change mind)
   - User provides detailed reason/summary
   - Version created through existing workflow
   - New version starts in DRAFT

BENEFITS:
✓ Code reuse (existing CreateNewVersionModal)
✓ No logic duplication (~100 lines saved)
✓ Better UX (user controls version details)
✓ Flexibility (can change minor/major decision)
✓ Maintainability (single version creation path)
✓ Consistency (same modal for all version creation)

FILES MODIFIED:
Backend (4):
- backend/apps/scheduler/services/periodic_review_service.py (simplified)
- backend/apps/workflows/models_review.py (outcome choices)
- backend/apps/documents/views_periodic_review.py (API validation)
- backend/apps/workflows/migrations/0005_*.py (migration)

Frontend (4):
- frontend/src/types/api.ts (types)
- frontend/src/components/documents/PeriodicReviewModal.tsx (modal logic)
- frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentViewer.tsx (integration)
- frontend/src/components/documents/ReviewHistoryTab.tsx (display)

Documentation (5):
- PERIODIC_REVIEW_UPVERSION_IMPLEMENTATION.md (backend details)
- FRONTEND_PERIODIC_REVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md (frontend details)
- REFACTORED_PERIODIC_REVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md (refactored approach)
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (quick reference)
- REPOSITORY_UNDERSTANDING_SUMMARY.md (updated workflow)

TESTING:
- Backend: Migration applied successfully
- Frontend: Containers restarted
- Integration: Ready for manual testing

CODE QUALITY:
- Separation of concerns: Review recording vs version creation
- DRY principle: No duplicated version logic
- Single responsibility: Each modal has one purpose
- Tested components: Reuses existing, proven workflow

Total: ~3,500 lines documentation + code
Lines saved: ~100 by eliminating duplication
