# 🔍 Debug Logging Added

## What I Added

Detailed console logging to see what the API actually returns:
- Full API response structure
- userResponse.user value
- userResponse.id value  
- Final currentUser object
- Final currentUser.id value

## Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R

2. **Open browser console:** F12 → Console tab

3. **Try creating document**

4. **Look for lines starting with 🔍 in console**

5. **Tell me exactly what you see** for these log lines:
   - 🔍 Full API response: {...}
   - 🔍 userResponse.user: ...
   - 🔍 userResponse.id: ...
   - 🔍 currentUser: {...}
   - 🔍 currentUser.id: ...

This will tell us the exact structure of what the API is returning!

**Action:** Hard refresh, try creating document, and copy the 🔍 log lines from console
